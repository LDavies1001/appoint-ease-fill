OPENSLOT PLATFORM AUDIT - JANUARY 2025

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
=================
This audit evaluates OpenSlot across 10 key areas. The platform has a solid foundation with clear dual-role user flows and consistent theming, but needs attention to image handling, address management, and UX refinement.

OVERALL ASSESSMENT: Good foundation with medium-effort improvements needed for launch readiness.

1. USER EXPERIENCE (UX)
=======================
STRENGTHS:
- Clear dual-role architecture (business vs customer)
- Logical onboarding flow with stepper components
- Role-based navigation and dashboards
- Clean authentication process

ISSUES:
- Complex business profile setup (too many steps)
- Address/service area confusion (multiple fields)

STRENGTHS:
- Proper Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Secure authentication and session handling
- Zod schema validation
- Proper environment configuration

ISSUES:
- File upload needs additional validation
